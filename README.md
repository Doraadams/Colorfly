# Colorfly
#### Mojang shouldn't have removed fireflies... Why not add them back, but better?
#### This mod adds the Colorfly, a new and improved Firefly entity for Minecraft. This isn't just a particle but rather a mob built from the ground up focused on ambiance and unique interactions with a Vanilla Minecraft feeling.

**Requires** [**Fabric**](https://fabricmc.net) **&** [**Geckolib**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)

## FAQ

-- **Colorflies will blink depending on the time of day, weather, and nearby non-hostile mobs!** *Maybe if you are a bit bored you can try to translate what they are saying... hint hint*

-- **You can capture Colorflies! Right-click them with a glass bottle for safekeeping. Then, whenever you want, craft them into a Colorfly lantern or release them back into the world!**

- *Colorflies won't despawn naturally if released, like fish or axolotl from buckets. Colorflies can also be given a nametag for the same effect.*

- *The recipe for a Colorfly lantern is almost the same as a normal lantern or soul lantern. Instead of using a torch, use a Colorfly bottle to craft! Green may not be the only color...*


-- **Potions of Glowing can be brewed using bottled Colorlies, but... how could you...**


-- **Colorflies will spawn in semi-large groups in most swamp and forest biomes, so be on the lookout for flowers or places bugs might be to find them!** *Forests that are dark or have flowers seem to be home to a special Blue Ghost variant...*


-- **Colorflies don't like Spiders, and Spiders don't like Colorflies. Colorflies also don't like Frogs, but *thankfully* Frogs couldn't care less.**
